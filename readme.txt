== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where do I find Gutenberg block? =

If you want to use Gutenberg block, you'll need to activate this addon under Hatchbuck > Addons. Remember, you need WordPress version 5.0 and up to use Gutenberg block.

= How do I embed form shortcode into my template file? =

Please use `do_shortcode()` function. For example: `<?php echo do_shortcode('[hatchbuck form="HTML-form"]'); ?>`

= Where do I find Hatchbuck API keys? =

Go to Account Settings > Data > API to get API key.
Go to Account Settings > Data > API > Tags to get a specific tag key.

= Will Hatchbuck track scroll box subscribers? =

At this point no. Hatchbuck API does not allow to set a tracking cookie, so we can't track visitors that completed scroll box form. The moment Hatchbuck allows cookie to be set in API, we'll add that functionality.

**Tip:** Add an email confirmation for scroll box subscribers, asking them to click on a link in your email to confirm subscription. When they click that link, Hatchbuck will begin tracking them.

= Where can I get support? =

Please visit "Support" tab above to request help on WordPress.org forums. We try to respond in a timely fashion.
